Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to introduce a system for EEG/ERP
   (electroencephalography, event-related potentials) data and metadata
   storage and processing and to summarize the authors' research in this
   field. Since researchers have difficulties with a suitable long-term
   storage and management of electrophysiology data the presented system
   helps them to increase both efficiency and effectiveness of their work
   by providing the means for the storage, management, search and sharing
   of EEG/ERP data. The requirements specification including the system
   context, system requirements, project scope, basic features, system
   users, and data formats and metadata structures are presented. The
   database structure is proposed; upload, download and interchange of
   EEG/ERP data and metadata using the web interface are described. The
   system architecture, used technologies and the final realization are
   described. Data and metadata search over the system and user accounts
   including system security management are also presented. Additional
   tools and structures as converters of data formats and semantic web
   ontology are mentioned.}},
