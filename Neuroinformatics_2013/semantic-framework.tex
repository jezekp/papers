\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Our research group specializes in the research of brain activity. The main interest of experiments is a measurement of reaction time e. g. drivers. We use methods of Electroencephalography (EEG) and its subdomain Event-Related Potentials (ERP). Measurement of EEG/ERP experiments is a time consuming task that produces a lot of data. With the increasing number of experiments their long-term storage has to be solved. Although many laboratories deal with data collection their long term storage is not satisfactorily solved. The most pressing difficulties is an absence of standardized generally used data formats. The data formats should describe not only raw data but researchers still more emphasize a need to have a well-defined metadata description of experimental data. As a suitable way to describe a specific domains seems to be its description by domain ontology.

There were formed several organizations that aim is to solve difficulties with sustainability of neuroscience databases. Probably the most important of them is International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) formed in 2005 \citep{INCF-evaluation-first-year}. INCF is being developing an infrastructure serves to national nodes developing a partial infrastructure of each specific domain.

The suitable medium for sharing experimental data should be the Internet. Despite the popularity of the Internet, how it is growing, it contains of a huge amount of information with  practically no classification. Such not classified data are not suitable for sharing. As a solution an extension called the Semantic Web, that is intended to give the data semantic meaning, is being developed. Ontology is considered one of the pillars of the Semantic Web.

As a result, suitable ontology that precisely describes domain of EEG/ERP experiments should help with its interpretation. However current software systems are usually object-oriented and semantic gaps between object-oriented code and Semantic Web languages are significant. We present a proposed mapping and its implementation that extends common object-oriented code by missing semantics. The proposed mapping we practically implemented within a custom Semantic Framework.

We developed EEG/ERP Portal \citep{ISI:000306821100004} intended to manage and share experimental data\footnote{http://eegdatabase.kiv.zcu.cz}. The internal structure of EEG/ERP portal is designed with respecting INCF recommendations \citep{incf-sustainability-report}. Integration of developed Framework within EEG/ERP Portal enables transformation of stored experiments into the Semantic Web structure. This structure provides access to data thought Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) \citep{NIF-Neuroinformatics}.

\section{Systems for Data Modeling}
\label{Systems for Data Modeling}

\subsection{Common Systems}
\label{Common_Systems}

Several ways to represent data in electrophysiology exist. Since raw data has to be extended by description metadata existing modeling techniques has to be investigated.  After analyzing several semantic data models \citep{0720407583} for years still only  essentially two data modeling formalism stay: \emph{entity-relationship-attribute (ERA)} and \emph{object-oriented (OO)} models.

While relational databases are based on relational model represented by a collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables object-oriented modeling describes the abstract syntax of modeling concepts, their attributes and relationships.

\subsection{Semantic Web Modeling}
\label{Semantic_Web_Modeling}

When World Wide Web (WWW) is the largest knowledge database available for human readers it consists of a huge amount of information with practically no classification. It is extremely difficult to handle this enormous amount of information. Although search engines as Google, Yahoo or Alta Vista several important disadvantages stays. Mainly, they have low precision, low or no recall, results are highly sensitive to vocabulary and results are single web pages.

One possible solution to deal with these difficulties is to develop increasingly sophisticates techniques based on artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. An alternative, probably most promising, approach is to represent web content in a form that is more easily machine-processable and to use intelligent techniques to take advantage of these representation. One of these approaches is the Semantic Web \citep{Semantic_Web_Primer}.


\section{Mapping Data Models}
\label{Mapping_Data_Models}

\subsection{Data concepts}
\label{Data_Concepts}
The main construct in object-oriented modeling (OOM) is an object. Since entities and their relations exist in relational databases the similar representation exist in OOM as well. Entities are represented by objects and its relations are represented by their association ends represented by class attributes. All objects should be unique so every object has an identity. This identity is represented by an object identifier (OID) that distinguishes it from all other objects. Similar mechanism exist in relational databases as well. 

Object-oriented concepts are described by UML diagrams. Object oriented programming languages use the concepts in practical sense. 

\subsection{Concepts Comparison}
\label{concepts_comparison}
\emph{Ontology Definition Metamodel}\citep{OMG2009} compares concepts of \emph{Web Ontology Language (OWL)} with the features of UML. It compares the features the two have in common with the features in one but not the other. 

\subsubsection{Similar Concepts}
\label{Similar_concepts}

Both UML and OWL are based on classes. While extent of UML classes is on or more instances, in OWL the extent of class is a set of individuals defined by URIs. Because all individuals are subclasses of an universal class \emph{Thing} and individuals may be instances of \emph{Thing} and not necessary to any other class, it can be used outside the system.
