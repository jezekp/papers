    abstract = {{Modular toolkit for Data Processing (MDP) is a data processing framework written in Python. From the user's perspective, MDP is a collection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and other data processing units that can be combined into data processing sequences and more complex feed-forward network architectures. Computations are performed efficiently in terms of speed and memory requirements. From the scientific developer's perspective, MDP is a modular framework, which can easily be expanded. The implementation of new algorithms is easy and intuitive. The new implemented units are then automatically integrated with the rest of the library. MDP has been written in the context of theoretical research in neuroscience, but it has been designed to be helpful in any context where trainable data processing algorithms are used. Its simplicity on the user's side, the variety of readily available algorithms, and the reusability of the implemented units make it also a useful educational tool.}},

abstract = {Scientists face many severe challenges in extracting value from the increasingly large volumes of data they generate. In this paper we describe the requirements we have derived from working across a wide range of e-science projects. In particular, the CARMEN neuroinformatics project has exposed a range of challenges due to a need to analyse and share large volumes of data. We have identified the four key activities required by scientists with whom we work, and designed an integrated systemâe-Science Centralâto provide them. This exploits three emerging technologies: software as a service to avoid the need for users to deploy and maintain any of their own software; social networking to allow users to collaborate by sharing data, services and workflows in a controlled manner and Cloud computing to provide scalable compute resources. The system can not only be used through any web browser, but also provides an API so that applications can build on the core functionality. We describe the requirements, and the design that flows from them. This includes data storage with in-built versioning and signing, an in-browser workflow editor and a job scheduling system that allows workflows to be run both on local âprivateâ clouds and the Microsoft Azure Cloud.
